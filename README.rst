Tabletop Weather Station, with sound pressure sensor support 
============================================================

The Tabletop Weather Station is an open source touch-capable weather station.
It measures temperature, humidity, air pressure and air quality index with
high precision.

See `here <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Kits/TabletopWeatherStation/TabletopWeatherStation.html>`__ for more details.

This fork adds suport for the tinkerforge sound pressure sensor.

Currently I have added:
* current decibel value on the first screen in a new column
* storing the decibel value in the sqlite db, like all other values
* graphics screen like the other screens for temperature, humidity, etc.
